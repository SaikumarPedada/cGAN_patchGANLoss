# cGAN_patchGANLoss
# Training and saving the model:
Conditional GAN (cGAN) by training with the KITTI 2015 stereo dataset (disp_occ_0, image_2, image_3) for stereo image synthesis.
The cGAN takes the left-view image of a stereo pair as input, along with the disparity map generated by MonoDepth2, to synthesize the corresponding right-view image. 
saves the model in stereo_gan_Adv_models folder:
               (i) final_discriminator.pth
               (ii) final_generator.pth
Training_info is about the loss of generator and discriminator for which the model trained over 50 epochs in google colab environment with T4 GPU.
# Note:
      The potential training required for accurate results need over 200+ epochs could be achieved only with the help of A100 (or similar) GPU. can also include various datasets along side of KITTI stereo 2015 such as Middlebury Stereo Dataset, SceneFlow, ETH3D Stereo Dataset, MPI-Sintel Stereo Dataset, TartanAir Stereo Dataset, ApolloScape Stereo Dataset..
# Testing the model:
cGAN.py is the model trained and saves the model weights as described
stereo_right_view.py is the model to test by loading the weights saved in stereo_gan_Adv_models folder
